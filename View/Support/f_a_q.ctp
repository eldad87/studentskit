                        The onus is on the student to show up on time for a registered class, and if they decide not to show up, the teacher still gets paid.

                        We give our teachers full control over their classroom, so they are free to make any decisions in regards to how they teach their classroom. A good technique to have all students muted but unmute each when taking or responding to their questions.
